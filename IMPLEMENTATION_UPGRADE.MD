## Current State Summary

The site is **React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 3.4** with `react-router-dom` v7. It has **7 static pages**, **16 components**, full **i18n** (RO / EN / IT), two Context providers (`BookingContext`, `LanguageContext`), a luxury color palette (gold, sage, bronze, cream) with Playfair Display + Inter fonts, and CSS-only animations (`fadeInUp`, `fadeIn`, `hover-lift`).

**What already exists and will be reused / upgraded:**

| Feature | Current | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| Hero | Static image + stats bar | **Upgrade** → video background + delayed headline |
| Testimonials | Manual prev/next carousel | **Replace** → Embla Carousel with autoplay |
| FAQ | CSS `max-h` accordion | **Upgrade** → Framer Motion animated accordion |
| Services list | Flat page with ServiceCards | **Keep** + add dropdown nav & dynamic detail pages |
| Booking modal | Full form modal via Context | **Keep as-is** |
| Translations | Centralized `translations/index.ts` | **Extend** with new keys |

**What is net-new:**
- Dynamic `/services/:slug` route + `ServicePage` component
- Services dropdown in Header
- Background video in Hero
- Embla Carousel integration
- Framer Motion library
- Quiz Modal (`QuizModal`)
- Scroll-reveal animations & page transitions
- Staff & Certificates homepage section
- Sticky mobile CTA button

## Asset Generation Strategy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **All images required for this upgrade will be generated by AI** using the image generation tool during implementation. No external assets or user-provided files are needed. For video, a high-quality still image will be generated and used as a hero background (since video generation is not available — the component will be built to accept a video file in the future if one is provided).

### Images to Generate

| Image | Description | Destination | Used In |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hero background** | Warm, professional dental clinic interior — modern treatment room with soft ambient lighting, clean white surfaces, dental equipment subtly visible, luxury spa-like atmosphere. Wide cinematic aspect ratio. | `public/images/hero-bg.jpg` | Hero section |
| **Staff photo – Dr. Alexandru Ionescu** | Professional headshot of a confident male dentist in his 40s, white coat, warm smile, clean clinical background. | `public/images/staff/dr-ionescu.jpg` | Staff & Certificates |
| **Staff photo – Dr. Elena Popescu** | Professional headshot of a female orthodontist in her 30s, white coat, approachable smile, clinical background. | `public/images/staff/dr-popescu.jpg` | Staff & Certificates |
| **Staff photo – Dr. Mihai Georgescu** | Professional headshot of a male oral surgeon in his 40s, white coat, authoritative yet friendly, clinical background. | `public/images/staff/dr-georgescu.jpg` | Staff & Certificates |
| **Staff photo – Dr. Maria Constantinescu** | Professional headshot of a female pediatric dentist in her 30s, white coat, warm and inviting smile, colorful clinical background. | `public/images/staff/dr-constantinescu.jpg` | Staff & Certificates |
| **Certificate 1** | Elegant ISO 9001 quality certificate, framed, professional typography, gold accents. | `public/images/certificates/iso-cert.jpg` | Staff & Certificates |
| **Certificate 2** | Professional medical accreditation diploma, ornate border, official-looking seal. | `public/images/certificates/accreditation.jpg` | Staff & Certificates |
| **Certificate 3** | Excellence award certificate with gold embossing, professional layout. | `public/images/certificates/award.jpg` | Staff & Certificates |
| **Quiz background** | Soft, calming dental clinic waiting room, blurred background, warm tones, inviting atmosphere. | `public/images/quiz-bg.jpg` | Quiz Modal |
| **Service detail hero images (×12)** | One hero image per service — each showing the relevant dental procedure/equipment in a premium, clean clinical setting. | `public/images/services/<slug>.jpg` | ServicePage |

> **Total: ~20 images** will be generated during implementation, at the start of each phase that requires them.

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1 – Dynamic Service Pages & Navigation Dropdown

This phase introduces dedicated, SEO-friendly detail pages for every service, reachable from a new dropdown menu.

---

#### [NEW] `src/data/services.ts`

Central data module exporting an array of `Service` objects:

```ts
interface Service {
  slug: string;          // URL-safe identifier, e.g. "dental-implants"
  icon: LucideIcon;
  category: 'preventive' | 'cosmetic' | 'restorative' | 'emergency';
  titleKey: string;      // keys into translations for i18n
  descriptionKey: string;
  whyThisTreatment: string;
  forWhom: string;
  guarantees: string;
  whyNotDelay: string;
  faqs: { q: string; a: string }[];
  metaTitle: string;     // SEO
  metaDescription: string;
}
```

- 12 service objects (exam, cleaning, prevention, whitening, veneers, makeover, implants, crowns, rootcanal, emergency, extraction, trauma).
- References translation keys so content stays i18n-aware.

#### [NEW] `src/pages/ServicePage.tsx`

- Uses `useParams()` to read `:slug`.
- Looks up matching `Service` from `services.ts`.
- Renders: hero banner (with **AI-generated service image**), full description, "Why this treatment?", "For whom?", "Guarantees", FAQ accordion.
- CTA to open `BookingModal`.
- "Service not found" fallback if slug is invalid.

#### [NEW] `src/components/ServicesDropdown.tsx`

- Hover (desktop) / tap (mobile) dropdown of all service titles grouped by category.
- Links to `/services/:slug`.
- Keyboard accessible (arrow keys, Escape to close).
- Styled: white bg, `shadow-lg`, `border-gold/20`.

#### [MODIFY] `src/App.tsx`

- Add route: `<Route path="/services/:slug" element={<ServicePage />} />`

#### [MODIFY] `src/components/Header.tsx`

- Replace plain "Services" link with `<ServicesDropdown>`.
- Mobile menu: expandable services sub-list.

#### [MODIFY] `src/translations/index.ts`

- Add `serviceDetail` keys for extended content (whyTreatment, forWhom, guarantees, whyNotDelay) in RO, EN, IT.

#### 🎨 Asset Generation (Phase 1)

Generate **12 service hero images** — one per service slug, each showing the relevant procedure/equipment in a premium clinical setting. Saved to `public/images/services/`.

## Verification Plan

### Browser Testing (Per Phase)

Each phase verified visually at `http://localhost:5173`:

**Phase 1 – Dynamic Service Pages & Dropdown**
1. Hover "Services" → dropdown with all 12 services grouped by category.
2. Click any service → navigates to `/services/<slug>` with AI-generated hero image.
3. Detail page shows full content: title, description, Why/ForWhom/Guarantees, FAQ, CTA.
4. Invalid slug → "not found" message.
5. Keyboard navigation works (Tab, arrows, Escape).
6. Mobile hamburger → services expand as sub-list.

**Phase 2 – Homepage Upgrades**
1. Hero shows AI-generated background image with overlay, headline appears after ~1.5s delay.
2. Testimonials auto-rotate every 3s, loop, pause on hover.
3. FAQ smoothly animates open/close with Framer Motion.
4. Staff section shows AI-generated headshots + certificate images.

**Phase 3 – Quiz Modal**
1. "Take the Quiz" → modal opens with first question.
2. Select answer → smooth transition to next question.
3. Complete all → results screen with recommended service.
4. "Learn More" → navigates to service page.
5. X closes modal at any point.

**Phase 4 – Animations & Polish**
1. Scroll homepage → sections fade/slide in on viewport entry.
2. Navigate between pages → smooth fade transitions.
3. Mobile: sticky CTA at bottom, tapping opens quiz.
4. Responsive across all breakpoints.
